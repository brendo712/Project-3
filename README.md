# Project 3 - Call of Duty Tournament Helper
By: Brendan Sutherland, Jacob Cutshall, Beau Seigfreid

This is a group project we created with a MERN stack. MongoDB and express on the backend with React.js on the frontend. 

This is the frontend of the project. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this app was to make an easy way of displaying tournaments so that you can see each player and see their skill level. Then with that data, you can create fair pairings of players based on skill level in the tournament. 

## Using The App

The app will be available for full deployment on heroku soon. The app allows you to create tournament IDs and list them. You can also create a user and have your tournaments bound to a user ID. Future deployments would allow for allow adding players to tournaments by pairing with rapid APIs Call of Duty API. The app already pulls data from the API but doesn't allow for population of the lobby. 

## Ease of Use
Each User will be able to register and then create a tournament upon registration. The tournament will hold their unique user ID as the owner. You can sign up by clicking sign up or alternatively you can login. 



## Technologies

The game is made mostly with JavaScript and React.js. The backend is on MongoDB and controlled by express.

## Unsolved Problems

Currently the app allows for you to add tournaments, edit tournaments, and delete tournaments but doesn't allow you to populate players despite the call to the API. 

## Forthcoming Features

The code is written in a way where non-users can make tournaments. That isn't analogous to the point of the app. We would also like to make it so players populate that way you can see the players in each lobby.
